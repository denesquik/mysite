                            At the beginner level, there are programs focused on basic language skills. Titles include “Let’s learn English,”
                            “Everyday grammar” and “Words and their stories”.

                        <p>
                            Are you short on time? 6-Minute English fits into even the busiest schedules. No excuses! 6-minute English is 
                            a news podcast produced every week and is aimed at intermediate speakers. Each episode comes with a list of 
                            vocabulary, a thought-provoking question, and a transcript so you can follow along in case you miss some words 
                            or phrases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The English here is spoken at a slightly slower speed than usual, making it much easier to understand. In addition,
                            there are hundreds of episodes going back to 2014. Try listening to one six-minute episode per day, and your 
                            vocabulary will grow in no time.
